# Swivel Academy Solution
>*Thanks for the opportunity to work on this project, although i could not complete every part ofthe project due to other commitments with my full-time job, 
but, i'm really glad to have worked on this within this short period.*

This solution contains three projects namely

1. **Swivel Academy WEB**
2. **Swivel Academy API**
3.  **Swivel Academy Database**

To create the database on your local machine, after cloning the project, kindly run **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**, open 
a query window after connecting to a server and run this [script](./SwivelAcademyDB.sql)

Here is an image of the database diagram ![Image of DBDiagram](./SwivelAcademydb_SchemaDesign.PNG)


For, the API, I attached a screenshot here ![Image of API](./SwaggerAPIOverview1.PNG)

>you may find this video of the API at work on my local machine [here](https://youtu.be/5fwBbS7_Zd0)

Here is a shared screen from the project web ![Image of API](./TeacherProfilePage.PNG)


Thank you.
